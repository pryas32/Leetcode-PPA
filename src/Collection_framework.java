public class Collection_framework {


    //Collection framework->Its a  collection of libraries used for implementation of basic da6a structure
    //like list,Set ,queue ,dequeue,map
    //List->arraylist,linkedlist, Vector ,Stack ->(these stack an vectr are thread safe its suggested to use arraylist instead of vector in single threaded env and simlilarly arraydeue instead of stack in single threaded env  they are used in single threaded env so recommendned to use arraylist over vector and arraydequeue over stack)
   // Arraylist->its an implementation of dynamic size array
    //linkedlist->its and implemnetation of double linked list
    //vector ->its an implemtation of dynamic size array
    //stack
    //Set->hashset->its an implementation of hashing
    //treeset ->it present the values in sorted order .its an implementation of red black tree
    //linkedhashset ->(implementation of hashset and linkedlist) -> maintain order of insertion
    //Map->stores key value pair  //hashmap ,treemap ,lonkedhashmap
    //hashmap->implemnetation of hashing(doesnt gauratneee order)
    //treemap->uses red black tree (result in sorted order but loosess insertion deletion complexity
    //linkedhashmap->used loinked list and hashmap (maintain sorted order
    //Queue->linkedlist(iimplemnetation of doubly linked list) ,arraydequeue(both ended queue),priorityqeue(implementation of heap)
     //Dqeueu :linkedlist ,arraydequeue.(Dequeue ->its a doubly ended queue )->insert and delete item at both the ends
    //linkedlist here is an implementation of doubly linked list & arraydequeu here is of array .)

    //collection class ->they are implemented on these data structures eg sort can be used on list ,
   // similarly we have binary_search which can be arrplied on list etc.
