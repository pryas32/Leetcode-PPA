    //abstracttion means





    //abstraction->in this we provide the top level view of the class and not its implementation
    //what happen in  abstraction
    //we make the method as abstract in base class and aloow child class to implememts those methods

    //there are two was of achiving abstraction in java
    //through interfaces
    //through abstract classes

//Properties of abstract classes
   // a abstact class can have more han one abstract method
    //a method without any data type is an abstract method
    //if there is any abstract method than that class is an abstract class
    //a class can be aabstract wirthout any abstrac t method
    //it can have constructor ,static method
    //we cant have instances of abstract class
    //An abstract can point to its child class
    //if child class doesnt implement the abstract method of parent class then its also abstract
