 interface interfaces {
    //second way to achieve abstraction through interfaces

   // properties of interfaces
    //all dta member are public static final by default
    //we can have default ,abstract,static method.
    //we cant have constructor in interface
    //an interface can extends multiple interface
    //a calss can implements multiple interfaces
    int a=10;//menas its public static final
//all methods are public by default
     void print();//here we need not to mention as public abstract in front of abstract method
     //compiler assumnes its public abstact
     //in subclass you need to write it as public
