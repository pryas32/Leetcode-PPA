////
////    multitasking->it means running more than oen task at the same time.
////        eg-Writing a report in Microsoft Word while streaming music on Spotify
////    and downloading a file in the background.(these are both different process)
////
////
////
////
////        multithreading->it measn runnig more than one task within the process eg
////    browsing the web and also listing song
////
////    more eg->formatting,debugging excel sheet
//// eg ->compiling code and debugging code.
////
////advantages of multithreading
////
////1.Paraallelism and resource utilization ->ie running more than one task simuntaneously
////    2.responsiveness->if one task is busy in downloading the files it doesnt means it wont responsive to other thread within process.
////
////
////
////     jvm helps in maintaining multiple threads
////
//// disadvantages
//// 1.debugging and formatting code becomes difficult.
//// 2. it can leads to race condition and deadlock
////
//// race conditon -> when two thread working on same shared variable can reasult into diffferent result
////  deadlock condition->one thread holding one resource and waiting for some other resource simliarly other thread holding one resource and waiting for other resource.
////
////
////two ways of creating thread
////
////    1.By extending the thread class
////    2.By Implementing the runnable interface.
