    //queue->linkedlist ,priority_queue(implemnretd using heap),arradequeue(insertion and deletion from both the ends)

//(dequeue->insertion and delettion from both the ends )

//collections->it inherit from the object class
    //it has functions like min ,max ,binary_search etch which can be applied on above data structure
