public class operators {
assignment operator(= ,+=,-+,*=,%=)
    in assgnment operator the associativity goes from R to L
            arthimetic -> in arithemetic the associatitvity goes from L to R
    int x=(a*b+c); the associavity goes from L to R;
    relational operator
           logical(&&,||,!=)
 short-cicuiting(a && b)->hota hain so only a and we wont check b
            similarly a||b -
    > will check a and not b
            relational operator used for comparing two things(>=,<=,==,>,<);
