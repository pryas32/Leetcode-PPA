public class generic {
//ehy prefer generics over normal type because we want error at the compile time not at the runtime

    //generic -> its used for writing the code once and can be used for multiple data type
    //this can be used for class functions and methods
    //class like Arrarylist ,linkedlist
    //interfaces like list ,map
    //generics are useful for non primitive data type.
