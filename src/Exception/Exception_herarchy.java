public class Exception_herarchy {



//          Object->its a  top class of java .every class inherit from this class)
//            |
//   Throwable->(it is the super class  .All class inherti from this class
//      |   |        in case of exception.It has methods like printstacktrace().every exception realted
//      |   |       class implement this method)

//    Error-| These are not in  our hand.like IO error /some file deleted
//           |
//          |
//        Exception -> thwse are the error which occur in program and its in our hand we need to handle it.
//
//
//   Exception are categorized into two categories
//            1.checked excetion-> they are cheked at compile time .we needd to write extra code to handle it
//    eg file not found.else jave will not compile the code
//
//
//            1.Runtime exception -> they are chejked at runtime eg arthemetic exception,array index out of bound exception ,null poiner exception
//            compiler will not force me to  writre extra code here to handle them.
