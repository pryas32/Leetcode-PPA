public class differerence_abstract_interface {

//similarity
    //cant create intances of both
    //can point to other refrences


    //difference
    //interface use when we dotn want constructor


    //when to use abtraction
    //when is-a-relationship like area
    //when want to use public ,private and protected methiods
    //when  we need non static  as well as non final mmebers  .
    //a class can implements multiple interface
    //an interface can extends multiple interface.

// we can only add static and default method in interfaces but cant override them as they cant be abstracxt
    //static and default methd will have their definition means have their implmentations
    //only abstact methiod we need to provide definition in child class
